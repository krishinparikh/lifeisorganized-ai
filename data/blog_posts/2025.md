# This completely changed my results 12.26.25

I’ll be honest.

This was a rough work year for me.

Nothing fell apart, and everything looked fine from the outside, but internally, it just felt heavy.

Projects stalled. Momentum felt slow.

Things that used to feel easy suddenly felt like pushing a boulder uphill.

But something shifted in the 4th quarter.

Part of it was the world calming down a bit.

The political climate, financial tension, and general uncertainty finally seemed to settle.

Yet the biggest shift came from something entirely in my control.

It wasn’t my marketing.
It wasn’t my system.
It wasn’t my social strategy.

It was my mindset.

I worked incredibly hard on it this year.

I dug into limiting beliefs I didn’t even realize I was carrying.

I questioned the thoughts quietly guiding my decisions.

I created new beliefs that supported who I want to become.

And the shift has been dramatic.

I feel lighter, clearer, and more excited about 2026 than I have in a long time.

So here are three mindset practices that genuinely changed things for me.

And I believe it can shift your year, too.

Step #1: Celebrate what you did, not what you missed
When a year feels tough, it’s easy to focus on everything you didn’t do.

The goals that slipped.
The habits that didn’t stick.
The moments when you felt behind.

But the truth is, you carried a lot.

You showed up when you were tired.
You pushed through uncertainty.
You supported others while juggling your own stress.
You took steps that nobody saw.
Celebrate that. Acknowledge it. Let it count.

Celebration tells your brain you’re capable.

Pro Tip: A simple way I’ve learned to do this is to write 2-3 lines in a journal of something good I did every day.

Step 2: Get honest about what you’re done tolerating
Better mindset work isn’t only about adding new thoughts.

It’s also about clearing out the ones that keep you stuck.

So ask yourself the question that changed everything for me this year.

What am I DONE tolerating in 2026?

Reality TV gif. Tamar Braxton from Braxton Family Values is being interviewed and she pouts heavily while throwing up a peace sign, saying, "I'm done."
Maybe you’re done tolerating overcommitting.
Maybe you’re done tolerating working without boundaries.
Maybe you’re done tolerating constant distractions, chronic urgency, or saying yes before thinking.
And here’s what I had to get honest about personally.

I had been tolerating excuses.

Excuses about not having enough time, not being good enough, and waiting for the perfect conditions that never come.

Letting go of those excuses was uncomfortable, but it freed up so much mental space.

I still catch myself falling back into them.

But when I stop believing my own nonsense, I regain momentum.

Once you decide what you’re done with, you stop repeating old patterns.

You protect your time and your energy.

And you step into the version of yourself who leads your life…Rather than reacting to it.

Step 3: Choose beliefs that support who you want to be
Your habits follow your thoughts.

When your mindset shifts, your actions shift.

What kept me grounded this year was choosing specific beliefs to return to every time things felt uncertain.

Here are ten beliefs that can carry you into 2026.

I can reset anytime.
My time is valuable, and I get to protect it.
I can choose clarity over chaos.
Progress is always possible.
I get to say no without guilt.
I can let go of what’s not mine to carry.
I can handle hard things.
I get to choose how I respond.
I can create the structure I need to succeed.
I can lead my day rather than react to it.
Pick the ones that speak to you and say them often.

They’ll shape your choices more than any planner or strategy ever could.

The Bottom Line
Your mindset sets the ceiling for your year.

Celebrate what you carried so you begin from strength.
Decide what you’re done tolerating so you can protect your time.
Choose beliefs that support the person you want to become.
If this year tested you, you’re not alone.

But 2026 can feel entirely different.

It starts with how you think long before it shows up in what you do.

Ready for an awesome year?

I know you are.

With love and appreciation,
Mridu

# This really is the best thing you can do this week 12.1.25

Picture this.

It’s Thanksgiving. (if you’re in the U.S.)

Your house is buzzing with people you love.

The kind of loud, happy chaos that fills your heart even as it fills every corner of your home.

And yet, you might feel your hand drifting toward your phone.

Not because you need to check anything urgent…

But because your brain is stuck in its default pattern.

Email. Messages. A quick scroll.

The muscle memory that pulls you right back into work mode, even when you’re surrounded by the people and moments you care about most.

If you’ve ever caught yourself doing that, you’re not alone.

We’re wired for constant checking, responding, and availability.

But here’s the thing.

Disconnecting is not about missing out.

It’s about showing up more fully.

And it’s one of the most powerful things you can do for your productivity, your leadership, and your well-being.

So as holidays approach, here are three simple steps to help you disconnect in a way that fuels better performance.

Step #1: Decide what disconnecting really means
You cannot rely on vague hopes to unplug.

Your brain needs a plan.

Be intentional and ask yourself:

“What does disconnecting really look like for the next few days?”

Maybe it’s no email after noon on Wednesday.
Maybe it is putting your phone in another room during meals.
Maybe it is checking messages only once a day instead of ten.
When you set an intention, you create freedom.

It gives your mind permission to rest instead of tugging you back into work mode.

Step #2: Set boundaries you can actually stick to
Disconnecting is easier when the temptation is out of sight.

Turn off email alerts.
Move work apps into a folder buried on page three of your phone.
Put your laptop away completely.
If you want to take it one step further, let a few people know you’ll be offline.

A simple “I will be unavailable after Wednesday” removes the mental pressure of wondering if someone is waiting for you.

But whatever you do, don’t rely on willpower.

It doesn’t work.

Use boundaries.

They protect your attention, your presence, and your capacity to enjoy the moments in front of you.

Step #3: Reset your internal clock
This part matters more than people realize.

When you step away from the constant noise of notifications, pay attention to the shift.

Does your body feel calmer?
Does your mind feel clearer?
Do you feel more connected to the people around you?
Your brain needs breaks.

Your nervous system needs space.

When you notice the difference, you reinforce the habit.

You teach yourself that disconnecting isn’t a luxury.

It. Is. Fuel.

The Bottom Line
If you want to return to work with more clarity, focus, and energy, disconnect this week.

Not because you’re slacking, but because recovery is part of high performance.

So this week, choose presence over pressure.

Let your phone rest. Let your mind breathe.

Show up for the people you care about and for the version of yourself that performs best when you are not running on fumes.

Your productivity will thank you.

Your leadership will thank you.

And most importantly, you will feel the difference.

# Want to do this tonight to cure brain fog? 11.20.25

“Who feels like they have brain fog most days?”

Last week I asked this to a leadership team.

Every hand shot up faster than free coffee on a Monday morning.

As we talked, the culprit became obvious.

Their nighttime habits were… let’s just say, aspirational.

Late-night emails.
Just one more episode.
Scrolling for 10 minutes that somehow lasted 40.
They were sacrificing the one thing their brains desperately needed.

Sleep.

More accurately, quality sleep.

If you want to be focused, productive, creative, or even remotely patient, sleep is the foundation.

Improve your sleep, improve your performance.

Here are three simple ways to do it.

Step #1: Remember: Late ain’t great
So much of your sleep quality depends on what you do before you get into bed.

Three common late-night habits make a big difference:

1. Eating late

Your body needs time to digest food, so finishing dinner (and dessert) earlier supports deeper sleep.

Aim to stop eating three hours before you hit the sack.

1. Drinking late

Don’t be fooled if you fall asleep quickly after a couple of vodka tonics.

It’s the quality that messes up, and why even with the right amount of sleep, you might feel groggy or tired.

1. Exercising late

And while exercise is great for you, workouts too close to bedtime can keep your heart rate high and your brain wired.

If evenings are your best option, aim for something earlier, like 7 p.m.

Small shifts in these areas make a big difference in your sleep quality.

And it’s a loop.

When you sleep better, you make better choices about eating, drinking, and exercising.

Step #2: Protect your last hour
The final hour before sleep is the difference between:

“Yes, I’m ready to take on the world!…or

“Can I stay under the covers for 3 more hours?”

Screens, heavy conversations, and mental stimulation keep your brain active.

A calmer transition tells your brain to slow down.

Use this hour to unwind with intention.

Read something easy
Listen to an uplifting book or podcast
Write about your thoughts or what you’re thankful for
Plan your next day
Cuddle with your partner (or fur baby…or baby baby)
Watching violent or deranged shows, scrolling until your eyes water, or getting worked up about world injustices don’t exactly create peaceful dreams.

Create a smoother path between your overstimulated day and the rest your body needs.

Step #3: Reset your internal clock
This surprises people, but one of the most powerful ways to improve your night depends on what you do in the morning.

Your brain runs on an internal clock. AKA: Your circadian rhythm.

The fastest way to set that clock is through light.

When your eyes get natural morning light, it sends a message to your brain that says, “It’s daytime, time to wake up, baby!”

You don’t have to take a long walk.

Just step outside for a minute or two.

Walk your dog.
Walk your child to the bus.
Grab the mail.
Stand on your porch and look toward the sky.

If you can’t get outside, open your blinds, turn on the lights, and brighten your space.

When your internal clock knows it’s morning at the same time each day, your body naturally knows when it’s time to wind down at night.

The Bottom Line
Sleep is one of the most powerful performance tools you have.

It’s the foundation of clear thinking, confident leadership, and sustainable productivity.

It’s the cure for brain fog.

If you want to raise the bar on your performance, your team’s performance, and your daily sanity…

Start with the habit that supports everything else.

Prioritize your sleep.

Hit reply and let me know: What’s one small shift you can make tonight?

# Instantly master these 3 morning hacks 11.12.25

Every morning, I block 90 minutes for 7 simple tasks:

I meditate, journal, pray, work out, visualize, drink green juice, and affirm my goals.

That’s why every day starts amazing.

Video gif. Against a soft pink background, a woman in a beige bathrobe with dreadlocks in a bun lifts a shiny pink sleeping mask from her eyes. She reacts with excitement as she notices us, and greets us with a big smile. Yellow text grows from bottom of frame, "Good morning."
Bahahaahahahahhhaaa.

I love it when I get you.

If that’s what it took, I’d still be under the covers.

Starting your morning on the right foot isn’t about stacking rituals.

It’s about creating enough calm and clarity so you feel ahead and not behind.

Here are three steps to help you do that.

Step #1: Remember: Success starts the night before
If your mornings feel rushed, the problem usually begins the night before.

You can’t wake up peaceful if you go to bed in chaos.

A few simple habits can change everything:

Decide your top priorities. Write down the 1–3 things you absolutely must get done tomorrow. That clarity alone will quiet your mind before bed.
Prep for morning you. Lay out clothes, tidy the kitchen, pack lunches, or set the coffee timer. These are small wins that eliminate friction.
Create a soft landing. Instead of scrolling, try reading, stretching, or writing a quick gratitude list. That calmness carries into your sleep and your morning mindset.
Your future self will either thank you or resent you when the alarm goes off.

Give it a reason to be grateful.

Step #2: Choose your first thought
Your alarm buzzes.

If your first thought is “I’m exhausted,” or “I have too much to do,” you’ve primed your brain for stress before your feet even hit the floor.

Try training yourself to start with something positive.

I swear, this one change was a game-changer for me.

As soon as I wake up, I ask myself two questions:

What’s one thing I’m grateful for? (get specific, like “This pillow is like sleeping on a cloud” or “I’m grateful that I have a closet full of clothes to choose from.”)
What’s one thing that could be great about today? (“I could hit every green light today” or “My WiFi will be strong all day.”)
(This second one is gratitude in disguise plus a way to look forward to the day.)

The Office gif. Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute scrunches his face with emotion, then looks up as he says, "Thank you."
Over time, this tiny shift rewires how you experience your mornings and your day.

Step #3: Protect your first 30 minutes
If mornings feel hectic, it’s usually because you start with everyone else’s priorities.

Emails, texts, and news alerts immediately hijack your focus and energy.

Your first 30-60 minutes set the tone for your entire day.

Use it intentionally.

Maybe it’s for going for a walk or planning your day.

But steer away from what I did last week.

I woke up to a client text.

By 8 am, I’d drafted 3 versions of a panicked email and was still in my pj’s.

No surprise, I was in reaction mode the rest of the day.

Don’t let it happen to you.

Give yourself at least 30 minutes to think and plan before picking up your phone.

Wouldn’t it feel awesome to start your day calm, centered, and in control?

The Bottom Line
A good morning isn’t about waking up at 4 am or standing on your head.

It’s about how grounded you feel when the day begins.

When you stop reacting and start directing, everything shifts.

And here’s the ripple effect:

When people start the day with intention, they make better decisions, communicate with more clarity, and set a calmer tone for everyone.

Ready to turn good mornings into productive, purpose-driven days?

Start with simple habits that work.

# You’re fried with a half-done list. What now? 11.6.25

I went to bed last night frustrated.

My brain was fried, my body was tired, and my list?

Still half undone.

I had been in motion all day with calls, emails, ideas, and interruptions.

But by the time my head hit the pillow, I couldn’t shake the thought:

How did I stay so busy and still not finish everything?

If that sounds familiar, you’re not lazy.

You’re just overestimating time.

Video gif. Lauren Lapkus throws her hands up to her temples and cries, “Whyyyyyyy?”
Most high achievers do it.

We underestimate how long things actually take.

We overestimate how much we can get done.

Then, when our list is still half-checked at the end of the day, we feel frustrated, defeated, and behind.

Here’s the thing.

The problem isn’t your motivation.

It’s your math.

Here’s how to fix it.

Step #1: Face reality on paper
If it doesn’t work on paper, it won’t work in real life.

Even with all your experience, I promise you…

A to-do list isn’t enough.

You can’t keep adding tasks without seeing where they fit.

Take your list and write down every single thing you think you’ll do today.

Then look at your calendar and start placing them into actual time slots.

This is where the magic happens.

When your list meets your calendar, you face the truth of your time.

You’ll instantly see what fits and more importantly, what doesn’t.

This is where the a-ha’s happen.

Don’t rely on your to-do list alone. It’s only half the story.

Step #2: Give tasks a realistic time
Now that you can see your day, it’s time to be honest.

How long will each task really take?

Not the fantasy version.

Video gif. A man turns to the camera and smiles at us with satisfaction. He wipes his hands clean of whatever task he's happily finished with. Rainbow flashing text, all caps: "All done!"
But the real one.

Writing a proposal isn’t 15 minutes.

It’s probably closer to 90.

Responding to emails isn’t 10 minutes.

It’s more like 45.

Finding the perfect GIFs for this newsletter isn’t 2 minutes.

It’s more like 10.

When you plan unrealistically, you only hurt yourself.

When you start estimating accurately, you stop pretending you can do ten hours of work in six.

Build a schedule that’s rooted in truth, not wishful thinking.

It’s that honesty that leads to confidence and calm.

Step #3: Protect what matters most
Once your list is connected to your time, the next step is to protect it.

Treat those time blocks like appointments with your future self.

First step: Actually put it on the calendar.

But then…

If something urgent comes up, move a block instead of erasing it.

If you don’t finish a task, reschedule it instead of shaming yourself.

The goal isn’t to do more.

It’s to do what matters most, intentionally.

When you protect your priorities, you end your day feeling accomplished.

Buh-bye failure!

The Bottom Line
Want to stop living in overwhelm and start living in clarity?

Connect your to-do list to your calendar.

You feel calmer, more in control, and far more productive.

Not because you did more, but because you planned better.

Try it today.

Take five minutes to map your tasks to your time and see how freeing it feels to live by reality instead of illusion.

You’ll finally end the day knowing you did exactly what you intended, and that’s what real productivity is.

It’s an emotion you feel when you get the results you want.

So, shoot me a message back to answer this:

What result do you want most today?

# 3 ways to effectively delegate (without losing control) 10.27.25

I get it. It feels easier to just do it yourself.

You tell yourself it’ll take longer to explain.

You already know how you want it done.

And honestly, you don’t fully trust that someone else will handle it the way you would.

So, you keep it all:

The project updates
The client follows ups
The inbox triage
The scheduling
Before long, you’re juggling every ball in the air and wondering why you’re exhausted, behind, and secretly resentful that no one’s helping.

The truth?

You’re not doing it all because you have to.

You’re doing it because you haven’t learned how to let go effectively.

Delegation isn’t dumping tasks or micromanaging them from the sidelines.

It’s a leadership skill. One that builds capacity, trust, and time.

Here are three ways to delegate effectively without losing control.

Step #1: Delegate the outcome, not the task
When you hand off a task, don’t just tell someone what to do.

Tell them why it matters.

Instead of saying, “Can you update the client report?” try,

“Can you make sure the client report clearly shows our progress this month and looks ready to share at the Board meeting?”

When people understand the outcome, they can make smart decisions without you.

They’re not just ticking boxes; they’re thinking strategically.

Why this works: You shift from being the bottleneck (approving every detail) to being the visionary (defining the goal).

That’s how leaders multiply their time.

Not by doing more, but by aligning others to the desired result.

Step #2: Set expectations up front
Most delegation fails because of unspoken assumptions.

You assume they’ll do it by Friday. They assume next week is fine.

You assume they’ll send it for review. They assume you’ll check it when you can.

Cue the frustration.

TV gif. Wearing a teal pullover, Courtney Stodden from Couples Therapy shows us she just can't right now as she leans back in her seat and covers her face.
When you delegate, clarify three things:

Timeline: “Can you get me a draft by Thursday afternoon?”
Format: “Please send it as a one-page summary, not a spreadsheet.”
Check-in: “Let’s touch base Wednesday morning in case you hit a snag.”
Clear expectations eliminate rework, confusion, and the “Did you get to that yet?” follow-ups that drain your energy.

Pro tip: Put it in writing.

A short email confirming next steps helps keep everyone accountable and reduces mental clutter.

Step #3: Trust, then tweak
If you’ve been burned before, you might think, “I delegated once, and it didn’t work.”

But delegation isn’t a one-and-done skill. It’s a muscle.

You build it over time.

Start small.

Delegate something low-risk.

Give feedback, not criticism.

If it’s not perfect, resist the urge to snatch it back.

Ask, “What worked well here?” and “What would make this stronger next time?”

Your goal isn’t perfection; it’s progress.

Each time you delegate and coach instead of correcting, you strengthen your team’s competence and your confidence to let go.

Remember: People rarely rise to the level of our expectations when we don’t give them the chance to.

The Bottom Line
You can’t lead and do everything yourself.

You can’t grow your business, your team, or your impact if you’re the only one holding the keys.

Effective delegation doesn’t take more time; it buys you time.

And maybe next time, when that little voice says, “It’ll just be faster if I do it,”…

…You’ll smile and think, “Not this time.”

# How to create habits that actually stick 10-21-25

I finally got back to meditating.

No, not hours on a cushion, envisioning a mountain top.

Five to ten minutes on my couch, next to my laundry.

I set a timer, closed my eyes, and breathed.

No perfect posture.

No incense.

A few quiet minutes, then on with my day.

It felt doable, so I did it again the next day, and the next.

Here are the three micro shifts that helped me make it work, and you can use them too.

Step #1: Make it embarrassingly small
I began with a strict 3-minute rule.

Couldn’t even make it to 5.

Embarrassing, I know.

But it was just enough time to get me over the hump of starting.

Added benefit: Turns out 3 minutes was long enough for my nervous system to feel a tangible shift.

Here’s the script I used:

Set a 3-minute timer, breathe in, and let go of doing this right.

If momentum shows up, continue.

If not, I still win.

The goal is to build the “I showed up” muscle.

That’s so much easier than “I did it perfectly” or “I got the best results!”

Remember, you’re in the building phase.

So simply showing up to your habit (no matter the form) is your main goal.

Step #2: Attach it to something you already do
Meditation finally stuck when I paired it with my morning coffee.

After I pour coffee, I sit in the same spot, open my timer, and breathe.

The coffee became my cue.

Use this formula:

“After I [current routine], I will [micro step]. “

Examples you can copy:

After I brush my teeth at night, I will deep breathe for 3 minutes.
After I park at work, I will sit in my car and write one text to let someone know I love/miss/or am thinking of them.
After I start my coffee machine, I will write down my top 3 goals for the day.
After I open my laptop, I will close my email and open my top task. Tab pinned.
After I finish lunch, I will walk to the end of the block. Shoes by the door.
Your existing routine does the remembering for you.

No extra willpower.

Just a simple link in your day that already happens.

Step #3: Remove one inch of friction
You are not the problem.

The setup is.

I made meditation the easiest option in the room.

Airpods are on the side table.

The timer app is pinned on my phone dock.

I keep a sticky note that says “Breathe” on the table.

Tiny frictions like hunting for earbuds or scrolling for an app are where habits die.

Remove one inch of effort.

Pre-set a 3- or 5-minute timer.
Pin your app.
Choose one spot.
Silence notifications for 10 minutes.
Put your phone on airplane mode.
Light a candle.
Shut the door.
Keep a cleared space.
Have a playlist ready.
Leave the weights out.
Set up your space or behavior to make the desired action easier than avoidance.

The Bottom Line
Big change doesn’t require big effort.

It requires small effort done often.

Start with a short amount of time, attach it to something you already do, and remove one inch of friction.

In other words:

Make it tiny.
Make it anchored.
Make it easy.
That’s how you make habits actually stick.

So, what’s one habit you could apply this to?

Shoot me a reply so I can cheer you on.

The first step to change is to make an intention.

What’s it gonna be?

# Too much to implement 10.10.25

You know when you feel really good about something you did, only to find out other people didn’t think it was quite so awesome?

I recently taught a three-hour class on focus, prioritizing, and time planning.

It went great.

Then I read the feedback.

“So many good ideas, but too many to implement.”

Ouch. They were right.

I had packed the session with my best stuff because I wanted to give maximum value.

Instead, I made taking action harder.

When they invited me back, I did something different.

I spoke on one topic only.

Focus.

We went deep on the science and data behind attention, the real-world blockers, specific same-day solutions, and plenty of collaboration and brainstorming.

The response was night and day.

“This is exactly what I needed.”

The content wasn’t better.

There was simply less of it.

If you want your message to land and lead to action, less is more.

Here’s a three-step way to do exactly that.

Step #1: Choose one outcome
Decide on a single result you want your audience to walk away with.

Not three. ONE.

If you’re leading a meeting, what should people do by Friday at 3 p.m.?
If you’re giving a talk, what behavior should change tomorrow morning?
If you’re writing an email, what is the next step the reader should take?
Say it out loud before you start.

“By the end, they will schedule a 25-minute focus block each day.”

That sentence becomes your filter.

If a slide, story, or statistic doesn’t serve the outcome, it doesn’t make the cut.

You will feel the urge to add one more tip.

Resist it.

Depth creates clarity.

And clarity creates action.

Step #2: Structure for action, not applause
Information is not the problem.

Implementation is.

Organize your message in a simple pattern that people can remember without a worksheet.

Try this sequence.

Name the problem in one sentence.
Say why it matters in one sentence.
Give three steps.
Then practice.

People don’t need more content.

They need a container that turns intention into motion.

Fewer ideas, more reps.

Step #3: Build memory hooks
Your audience will forget most of what you said unless you make it sticky.

Create short labels, simple visuals, and real examples. Like this:

Short Label: “Start, Slice, Silence.”

Simple Visual: Sketch a calendar box with one block shaded.

Real Example: Tell the story about the proposal you tried to write with 14 tabs open that ended up in the sock drawer organization.

Repeat your core idea three times in different ways.

Tell them what you will tell them.
Tell it.
Tell them what you told them.
Then, ask for a tiny commitment.

“Reply with your focus block time for tomorrow.”

Memory loves rhythm and repetition.

Make your point easy to recall when the day gets busy.

The Bottom Line
Grab your next meeting, presentation, or email and run it through this filter.

One outcome.

One simple structure that ends in practice.

One memory hook that sticks.

Cut the rest.

You’re not watering down your value; you’re concentrating it.

When you trade volume for clarity, your message shifts from “That was interesting” to “I did it.”

And isn’t that the point?

# How to quickly prioritize 10-8-25

I get it.

You have 101 things on your list and all of them matter.

I can’t tell you if your system build or your client deliverable is “more important.”

Some days, ten tasks deserve to be at the top.

Here’s what I can tell you:

Prioritizing isn’t hard.

Deciding is.

When it comes to deciding, there’s only one wrong move.

INDECISION.

It looks like this:

Rewriting the to-do list again and again.
Jumping between tasks every few minutes.
Dipping a toe into five projects so you feel busy but finish nothing.
Indecision steals confidence and momentum.

The antidote is simple:

Make one decision and stick with it long enough to make visible progress.

Here’s a three-step way to do exactly that.

Step #1: Brain dump everything on your mind
Get everything out of your head and into one place.

Set a 3–5 minute timer and list every task, obligation, and open loop:

Client follow-ups
Proposals
Hiring
Reviews
Find the password you swore you’d remember…
Everything.

Don’t organize, evaluate, or wordsmith.

Just dump.

Now draw a line under the last item and stop.

This list is not your plan; it’s your inventory.

You’ve emptied the mental junk drawer, so you can choose with a clear head.

Quick sort (30 seconds):

Put a ★ next to anything that has a true deadline today.
Put a ⚠️ next to anything that becomes a problem if ignored.
That’s enough to move on.

Mantra: “Empty head, better decisions.”

Step #2: Choose one priority (quickly).
“Whatever priority I choose is the right one.”

Say that to yourself.

Then, say it again.

Because the magic is not in picking a perfect task.

The magic is in committing.

Give yourself two minutes to decide.

If you need help, use one of these quick prompts:

Impact first: Which task, if completed, moves a business outcome this week?
Risk first: Which task, if ignored today, creates the biggest problem?
Energy match: Which important task fits my energy for the next hour?
Pick one.

Write it at the top of your page: “Today’s Priority.”

Everything else is a good idea for later, not for now.

Now start.

Take the first tiny action:

open the doc
paste the outline
pull the data
make the call
Great – you DECIDED. Honor the decision.

If you drift, don’t judge it.

Reset and come back. Progress loves a comeback.

Remember the mantra: “Whatever priority I choose is the right one.”

Step #3: Close the loop and choose the next one.
When you reach a natural stop, close the loop:

Save, send, ship, or log what you finished.

Then take one minute to capture learnings:

What helped me focus?
What got in the way?
What will I change for the next block?
Now choose the next priority.

Not five. One.

Repeat Step 2.

Mantra: “Decide, do, repeat.”

The Bottom Line
When everything’s important, you rarely need the perfect decision.

You need a quick decision.

Your brain will try to complicate this. Don’t let it.

Remember, whatever priority you choose is the right one.

Try this today.

Braindump for three minutes.
Pick one priority and take the tiniest micro-action to start.
Close the loop, then choose the next one.
That’s how you prioritize when everything is important.

You decide and you stick with it.

Simple wins. Every time.

Quick…what’s your next priority right now?

Decide and shoot me back a reply.

# Want to stop feeling behind right now? 9.26.25

You know when you plan a quick task…and it eats up your whole afternoon?

Like, you stack four “easy” to-dos into an hour window and only finish one.

And you think: “What’s wrong with me? Why can I never get it done?”

Nothing is wrong with you.

You’re just a smartypants caught up in optimism bias.

It’s the gap between what you THINK you can get done and what you ACTUALLY finish in real time.

And it makes you feel behind even when you’re moving.

The fix is not more grit.

It’s a simple process that makes you realistic and your wins repeatable.

Step #1: Scope Smaller Than Your Brain Wants.
If a task is more than 30 minutes, break it down into small slices.

Instead of “Write the proposal,” try:

Draft outline
Bullets for each section
Draft section one
Then, estimate a time to finish each broken-down slice.

Like this:

Draft outline: 20 mins.
Bullets for each section: 15 mins.
Draft section one: 45 mins.
Pro Tip: Add a small buffer to your estimate.

10% for familiar work.
20-15% percent for new or messy work.
If you’re into realistic expectations, buffers are super important.

They’re protection against context switches, quick checks, and the two minutes it takes to find that file.

Step #2: Put It On Your Calendar and Protect It.
A task list is intention.

A calendar block is commitment.

Place the slice on your calendar with a start and end time.

Treat it like a meeting with a client.

This is where the magic happens.

This one habit turns wishful planning into an actual plan you can follow.

It also shows you the truth about your capacity today.

It will cause you to either move something else on your calendar or change your expectations about what you can get done.

Some days hold two meaningful slices.

Some hold five.

Seeing that in black and white removes the guilt and the guessing.

Pro Tip: When it’s time to work, reduce friction in the first two minutes.

Silence notifications and clear the desk.

Step #3: Review and Recalibrate.
When the block ends, capture two quick notes:

How long it took
What got in the way
If your 30-minute slice took 45…Schedule 45 next time.

Don’t pretend or fool yourself into thinking it will take less time the next go around.

If email derailed you, plan to close the inbox for the first 20 minutes tomorrow.

This is the step people skip, yet it’s where optimism bias loses power.

You’re no longer guessing.

You’re learning your true speeds for writing, analysis, reviews, and approvals.

Share these ranges with your team so expectations match reality.

“This type of client recap takes me 40 to 50 minutes when the data is ready.”

Clear ranges reduce pressure, prevent last-minute scrambles, and make collaboration easier.

The Bottom Line
Optimism bias is normal, but that doesn’t make it helpful.

It’s a planning habit you can upgrade.

Scope smaller so you can finish
Schedule the slice so it happens
And review so you get smarter every week.
Do one 20-minute block today and write down the real time.

Repeat tomorrow.

In a few days, your to-dos will fit your day…

And the feeling of being behind will give way to steady progress.

You don’t need longer hours.

You need honest plans.

# 3 easy steps to actually reach your goals 9-9-25

The difference between people who succeed and those who don’t often comes down to one thing:

Successful people set goals and actually reach them.

It sounds simple, but here’s where most of us get stuck.

We’re great at creating the vision:

Long-term dreams
Milestones
Workflows
Personally, I love color-coded plans. Feels so good!
But when it comes to the day-to-day?

That’s when overwhelm hits.

Suddenly, there are too many tasks and no one, clear next step.

The key to consistent progress isn’t more planning.

It’s this simple three-stepper.

Step #1: Plan Two-Week Sprints
Sprints are short, focused periods where you commit to reaching one specific goal in two weeks.

Why two weeks?

It’s long enough to make progress you can actually see.
It’s short enough to prevent procrastination.
It keeps urgency high, so you can’t push things off until “later.”
When you set monthly or quarterly goals, they feel far away.

That distance makes it easy to delay action until you’re suddenly scrambling at the end.

Two-week sprints cut out the wiggle room.

You’re forced to act now, and to act consistently.

Step #2: Make Goals Tangible and Specific
One of the biggest mistakes I see is keeping goals vague.

“Grow sales,” “get healthier,” or “be more organized” are nice visions…

But they don’t give you a clear action path.

Take my client Christine.

Her goal was to “get more sales.”

She had quarterly plans and monthly workflows.

But every Monday morning, she was staring at 1,200 possible tasks to make it happen.

TV gif. Wearing a teal pullover, Courtney Stodden from Couples Therapy shows us she just can't right now as she leans back in her seat and covers her face.
What did she do?

The same thing many of us do.

Buried herself in emails instead of moving the needle.

When we reframed her goal into a two-week sprint, it became specific and tangible:

“Have three sales conversations in the next two weeks.”

From there, the tasks practically wrote themselves:

Create a spreadsheet of people to reach out to.
Draft a short outreach script.
Call or email 10 people to book conversations.
Write three follow-up emails.
Now Christine had a focused plan, clear actions, and a defined finish line.

No more spinning, no more confusion.

Step #3: Build Confidence Through Quick Wins
The beauty of two-week sprints is the momentum they create.

When you reach a small but meaningful goal quickly, your brain registers a win.

And wins build confidence.

That confidence inspires you to keep going.

It sparks energy, refuels creativity, and reminds you that progress is possible, right now.

Instead of waiting months to feel a sense of accomplishment, you feel it every two weeks.

Over time, this cycle compounds.

Sprints lead to big results without the burnout of chasing too many goals at once.

The Bottom Line
Your success doesn’t come from creating endless plans or drowning in lists.

It comes from setting clear, specific goals and achieving them in short, focused bursts.

Two-week sprints force you to get started, keep you accountable, and build the confidence to keep going.

You can spend the next year inching forward on dozens of vague goals…

Or you can start making measurable strides every couple of weeks.

The choice is yours.

# This keeps you from getting what you want 8.27.25

Do you wish you were further along with a work goal? Or a personal one?

I’d love to help you take your results to the next level.

The first step is identifying what’s holding you back.

And one of the biggest things that’s blocking you from being your most productive and powerful self is, well…

YOU.

Specifically, that little voice in your head.

Your mind chatter.

It’s so generous, isn’t it?

Always offering you plenty of reasons why you can’t.

Why you’re not experienced enough, smart enough, good-looking enough, worthy enough, old enough, young enough, or ready enough.

The list never ends.

But here’s the truth:

Mind chatter is less about reality and more about your brain doing its job: Keeping you safe from risk.

And while that’s useful when you’re crossing a busy street, it’s not so helpful when:

You’re stepping into a bigger role at work
Pitching a new idea
Or finally starting that project you’ve been dreaming about
So how do you quiet the noise and move forward with clarity and confidence?

Try these three simple but powerful strategies.

#1: Remember, it’s just your brain doing its job
Your brain’s #1 responsibility is survival.

Which means anytime you step into new territory: asking for a raise, leading a big meeting, or launching a new service…

Your brain waves red flags:

“This is scary! Don’t do it!”

Recognizing this can be freeing.

It’s not that you’re unqualified or incapable.

It’s simply your brain trying to protect you from what feels risky or uncomfortable.

So the next time those doubts show up, instead of fighting them, acknowledge them:

“Thanks, brain, for looking out for me. But I’ve got this one.”

#2: Don’t believe everything you think
Just because a thought shows up doesn’t make it true.

Imagine your brain tells you:

“You’re not ready to lead this project. People will see right through you.”

Now pause.

Is that a fact or just a thought?

If it were a fact, it would stand up in a courtroom.

Instead, it’s often a half-truth or a worst-case scenario.

So challenge it.

Replace “I’m not ready” with “I may not have led this exact project, but I’ve successfully managed dozens of others.”

That’s evidence.

That’s truth.

When you stop treating your thoughts like facts, you strip them of their power to hold you back.

#3: Ask yourself what is true
Here’s my favorite question when self-doubt hits:

“What actually makes me qualified?”

For example, maybe you’re preparing to roll out a new company-wide initiative.

Your chatter insists:

“I’m not the right person to lead this change. What if people push back?”

But then you remember:

You’ve successfully guided the organization through other transitions
You’ve built trust with leaders across departments
You deeply understand your company’s people and culture
This shift turns the spotlight from what you lack to what you already have.

And that’s where confidence grows.

Bottom Line
Mind chatter will always be part of the human experience.

But when you recognize it for what it is – your brain’s protective instinct, not the ultimate truth – you regain control.

The next time that noisy inner voice pipes up, remember:

You don’t have to believe it.

Acknowledge it, question it, and then redirect your focus to what is true.

That’s how you move closer to the opportunities, goals, and results you want.

Because the most powerful version of you isn’t the one without mind chatter.

It’s the one who knows how to manage it – and keeps moving forward.

# Got sucked into email…again?! 8.21.25

When I asked 50 realtors during a training how they feel about email, there were mostly like,

How can something so good be so bad?!

Video gif. A young blonde haired girl in high pigtails drops her chin in confusion as she twists her head with her tiny palms up in wonder.
We know email is super powerful.

But it's also one of the biggest thieves of our time, energy, and focus.

It leaves you drained before you’ve even tackled your real priorities.

The truth is, your inbox will take as much of your attention as you give it.

With a few intentional changes, you can stop the addiction.

Here are three steps to make your inbox work for you.

Step #1: Get Fewer Messages

If you receive 100 emails on Monday and 200 on Tuesday, you'll spend twice as much time on email on Tuesday.

Seems obvious, right?

It is.

Yet most of us don't focus on simply getting fewer messages.

The fewer emails you receive, the less time you spend in your inbox.

And that is time you could be using for higher-value activities.

One of the fastest ways to cut down on volume is to unsubscribe ruthlessly.

Every extra newsletter, promotion, or update you never read is taking your time and mental bandwidth.

When an email lands in your inbox that you do not need, don't just delete it.

Scroll to the bottom and click UNSUBSCRIBE (or mark it SPAM).

Step #2: Check Less Often

Research shows that the average professional checks email 75 times a day. Seventy-five!

That's about every six minutes.

No wonder it feels impossible to focus.

Every time you check your email, you break your concentration.

You pay a “switching cost” to get back into your work.

Those constant interruptions drain your mental energy.

Here's a better approach.

Set specific times to check your inbox and stick to them.

Like, 9 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m.

This way, you still check it throughout the day and stay responsive, but you protect time for deep work, too.

If you're worried about missing something urgent, set up filters or alerts for truly critical emails from specific senders.

That way, you're not scanning everything constantly just to catch one or two important messages.

Okay, so you’ve cut the noise and the time spent.

Now, let’s tackle when you look at what’s left.

Step #3: Decide. Decide. Decide.

How many times have you read the same email multiple times without acting on it?

You read it, mark it unread, read it again later, mark it unread...

Each time you revisit it, you spend more time and mental energy than necessary.

Adopt a one-touch rule.

When you open an email, decide what to do with it right away.

The 4 D’s are a great guide: Delete, Do, Delegate, or Defer.

If it takes two minutes or less, Do it immediately.
If it's not needed, Delete it.
If someone else should handle it, Delegate it.
And if it needs more time or information, Defer it by adding it to your task list with a specific follow-up date.
Don't just mark it unread.

That was the old you.

The new you DECIDES!

The Bottom Line

Your inbox should serve you, not the other way around. By

Reducing the volume of emails
Checking them less often
And managing them with purpose...
You reclaim hours, lower stress, and focus on what matters most.

So the next time you find yourself on your third inbox scan before 10am, pause and remember:

Email is a tool, not your boss.

When you take charge, you win back your time, your focus, and your sanity.

What small change will you make to stick with that?

# Want to feel more in control? Stop doing these 3 things. 8.14.25

You know those days where you’re working nonstop but still feel like you didn’t do anything?

You showed up, stayed busy, and crossed things off…

But somehow, your brain is fried, your to-do list is untouched, and you feel behind on what really matters.

Yep. Been there.

And it’s so defeating.

Video gif. Lauren Lapkus throws her hands up to her temples and cries, “Whyyyyyyy?”
Here’s what I’ve learned after years of helping professionals take control of their time:

Productivity isn’t just about what you do.

It’s about what you stop doing.

If you’re craving more clarity, momentum, and peace in your day, hit pause on these 3 things that quietly steal your time and energy.

Thing #1: Stop Getting Bossed Around By Your Phone
Every ping, buzz, and banner drags you away from what matters.

It lures you into a spiral of half-finished thoughts and scattered energy.

You don’t mean to give your phone that kind of power…but here we are. AGAIN.

So here’s the power move:

Turn. It. Off.

Silence the alerts.
Disable the badges.
Hit pause on your inbox.
Shut down the apps that keep sucking you in.
You don’t need more willpower.

You need fewer interruptions.

Take 60 seconds to clean up the noise, and watch how fast your clarity returns.

Seriously, change just one thing on your phone to limit the distractions. Just one.

You can dooooooo it!

Thing #2. Stop Falling into the Email Void
You get 15 free minutes between meetings.
Your 1:00 cancels.
You finish a task early.

And what’s the default move?

“Just check email.”

Before you know it, you’ve spent 40 minutes reacting to everyone else’s agenda while your own priorities sit untouched.

Here’s the fix:
Schedule time for email.

Good news! You’re already a pro at this. You schedule meetings and doctor appointments…you can do this too.

Maybe you schedule email four times a day.
Maybe it’s 20 minutes after every deep work session.
Maybe it’s 10 minutes every hour.
There’s only one wrong way to do it.

And that’s to not do it at all.

Make a decision and put it on the calendar.

Otherwise, email becomes the easy fallback every time you feel uncertain, unmotivated, or overwhelmed.

Which, let’s face it, is All. The. Time.

Thing #3. Stop Relying on Your Memory
You’ll remember to follow up with that client.
You won’t forget to call the plumber.
You’ll totally remember to send that doc before the meeting.

Until…you don’t.

Your brain was made for creativity and problem-solving, not for storing a million open loops.

So stop overloading it.

Get things out of your head and into a trusted system.

A notebook. A task app. A spreadsheet. Sticky notes, if you must.

The point is to release the mental clutter so you can focus on what matters…

…Without that nagging “I’m forgetting something…” feeling lurking in the background.

Be obsessive about getting thoughts out of your brain.

The Bottom Line
These might sound like small shifts, but they create big wins:

More peace. More progress. More ownership of your day.

You don’t need a total overhaul.

Just a few intentional changes to feel back in control.

You’ve got too much brilliance to waste it on distractions and overwhelm.

So, which one will you commit to first?

Will you finally silence those notifications?
Protect your email time?
Start writing it all down?
Let me know in a quick reply, and let’s get you back in the driver’s seat.

With love,
Mridu

# 3 keys for true productivity 8.5.25

After coaching hundreds of professionals, from attorneys to executives to entrepreneurs, I’ve noticed something, Brooke.

People aren’t struggling because they’re not working hard.

They’re behind and stretched thin because they don’t know how to :

Focus
Decide
Keep up with their mental load
They’re doing a lot, but not always the right things in the right way.

That’s why I created a simple framework to feel productive, not just look it.

I call it “The 3 Shuns.”

When you align these three areas, you don’t just get more done.

You get the right things done with less stress. It’s divine.

#1: Attention: (aˈtenSHUN)
If your attention is constantly all over the place, it doesn’t matter how ambitious your goals are.

You’ll always feel behind.

Hear me, friend: Focus isn’t a trait you’re born with.

It’s a skill you build, strengthen, and protect.

It means setting yourself up for focus – BEFORE your head explodes.

Things like:

Turning off non-essential notifications
Blocking time on your calendar for work that matters
Setting up a space so you actually concentrate
Saying no to multitasking or quick yeses that derail you
When you manage your attention, you shift from scattered to strategic.

YOU drive the agenda, instead of reacting to everyone else’s.

#2: Intention: (inˈtenSHUN)
You can’t do everything.

And trying to will only leave you frustrated and burned out.

That’s why getting clear on this shun, is so important.

What if your priorities were set before everyone else’s got louder?

That could look like:

Choosing your top three priorities each day
Mapping tasks to your weekly or monthly goals
Saying “not now” to things that don’t align with your current focus
Blocking and sticking to time for your most important work
When you work with intention, you stop measuring productivity by how many things you check off…

And start measuring it by how aligned your time was with your goals.

And when it happens…it feels AMAZING!

#3: Retention: (reˈtenSHUN)
This shun brings it all home.

If your brain feels overloaded, it’s not because you’re forgetful.

It’s because you’re trying to hold too much in your head.

Retention is about building reliable systems so you can stop mentally juggling everything.

It allows you to feel present (and make space for all that other good stuff you keep saying you want).

This includes:

A task and project management system you can trust
A calendar that reflects your goals, not just back-to-back meetings
A consistent place for notes, follow-ups, and reminders
Workflows for tasks you do over and over again
With good retention systems, you’ll stop reinventing the wheel.

And you’ll create much-needed momentum.

So those are The 3 Shuns. Want to see the polished, corporate version of this framework?

So glad you asked. I love a good PowerPoint!

The Bottom Line
Productivity isn’t about doing more.

It’s about doing the right things, with the right focus, at the right time.

When you align your:

Attention (how you focus)
Intention (what you prioritize)
Retention (how you organize and follow through)
You get results that feel meaningful, not just busy.

And isn’t that the point of working so hard and putting in all your energy?

Life flies by, and sure, not every day will be amazing…

But I’d love for most of your days to feel truly fulfilling.

If you’re not there yet, ask yourself which “shun” needs your attention.

Hit reply and tell me: What’s feeling hardest for you right now?

# The #1 reason you feel unproductive (even when you’re busy) 7.29.25

Picture this.

It’s Saturday.

You’ve got a laundry list of to-dos swirling in your head:

clean out the fridge
pay bills
return that Amazon thing
finally book the dentist
But instead, you sit on the couch, open Netflix, and before you know it…

It’s dark out and you’ve binge-watched an entire season of something you won’t even remember next week.

Cue the guilt.

Now let me paint you the same exact day, but with one tiny difference.

It’s Saturday.

You’ve got that same list in your head.

But this time, you’ve already decided:

“Today, I’m relaxing. I’m watching TV, ordering takeout, doing absolutely nothing, and I’m owning it.”

Same couch. Same show. Same time warp.

But this time? You feel amazing. Rested. Recharged.

Even accomplished.

Why?

Because productivity is about doing the things you intended to do.

It’s what you feel when your actions match your goals.

To feel productive, follow these 3 steps.

Step #1: Pick 3 goals before you’re off and running
Before you rush into your day, take two minutes, literally, two, to decide what you want out of it.

Don’t wing it.

Your brain wants clarity, not chaos.

Whether it’s finishing a report, having a hard conversation, or intentionally chilling…

You need to choose.

That way, you’re not reacting all day.

You’re leading it.

Your brain will want you to skip this step.

Don’t.

Three goals keep it focused and doable.

And yes, one of them can be “watch TV and recharge guilt-free.”

Step #2: Put them on your calendar
This is where the magic happens.

Once something has a time and place, it becomes real.

You’re more likely to follow through, less likely to feel scattered, and way more likely to say no to distractions.

Time-blocking doesn’t have to be fancy.

Just sketch out your day with intention.

Even if it’s “record videos from 10–11” or “Netflix from 6-8”…

You’ve gone from wishful thinking to an actual plan.

Remember, how you feel tonight will depend on whether your results matched your intentions.

Step #3: Celebrate, even if you only get two done.
Because done is better than guilt.

You showed up for yourself. You made progress.

That’s worth a fist bump (or at least a deep breath of relief).

Wanna know what happens when you don’t acknowledge your wins?

Your brain will always chase what’s next and never feel like enough.

A simple mental high five builds momentum.

So go ahead and feel good about what did happen.

Stop obsessing over what didn’t.

The Bottom Line

You don’t need to do more to feel better.

You just need to do what you meant to do.

You’re not measuring your worth by how busy you were.

You’re measuring it by how aligned you were.

That’s the shift.

Less pressure. More clarity.
Less guilt. More confidence.

So next time you find yourself spiraling because you “didn’t get enough done,” ask yourself:

Did I do what I set out to do?

And if not, good news.

You get to reset that intention anytime.

Even right now.

Give yourself that power.

That grace. That structure.

# Quickly simplify your work-life boundaries 7.15-25

Ever feel like work bleeds into every part of your life?

You sign off…but then just check “one more” email.

You finally sit down for dinner…and your mind drifts back to your unfinished project.

You try to unwind, but your office stares at you from the corner of your bedroom.

When work creeps into your personal time, your productivity and well-being both take a hit.

That’s why boundaries aren’t just a nice idea – they’re essential.

Here are three simple ways to create a better work and life separation, without the guilt.

Step #1: Define Your Work Hours
When does your day actually begin and end?

If your answer is, “It depends…” that’s your first red flag.

Clarity is key.

Choose your work hours.
Communicate them clearly to your team (and your family).
Stick to them.
If you’re in back-to-back meetings and finally “get work done” at night…

It’s time to reevaluate your schedule, not extend your workday.

When people know your boundaries, they’re more likely to respect them.

And when you know your boundaries, you’re more likely to protect your energy.

Step #2: Create a Dedicated Workspace
If your office is also your kitchen table, couch, or your bed…it’s no wonder it’s hard to unplug.

Your brain needs physical cues to shift gears.

Have a dedicated space.

Even a corner with a chair and a plant.

It signals when it’s time to work and when it’s time to rest.

And if you do have to work in a shared space…

Create rituals to mark the start and end of your day:

Light a candle when you begin
Shut your laptop and put it out of sight when you end
Change your clothes
Take a walk around the block
These simple transitions help your brain reset.

They keep work from spilling over into your personal time.

Step #3: Schedule Personal Time
Don’t just wait for balance. Plan for it.

If you’re only squeezing in personal time after everything else is done, it will never happen.

Life is busy. Work is full.

There’s always more to do.

Rest and connection aren’t luxuries.

They’re fuel.

So treat your personal time with the same respect you give a client meeting or a team call.

Block it on your calendar.

Name it. Protect it.

A walk with your partner
A lunch break outside
Reading, gardening, calling a friend…whatever fills your cup
And here’s the magic:

When your team or family sees you honoring your personal time, it gives them permission to do the same.

This is how you build a culture that values recovery, not just results.

The Bottom Line

Boundaries aren’t barriers.

They’re the structure that protects your time…

Your energy…

And your ability to show up fully.

You don’t need to overhaul your entire life.

Just pick one new boundary to protect this week.

You’ve got this.

Reply back and let me know what it’s going to be.

# Want to know why focus sucks every day? 11.03.25

I recently heard a quote that stopped me in my tracks:

“What owns your attention owns your results.”

It hit me because it’s painfully true.

If distractions, negativity, or other people’s priorities are owning your attention…

They’re also quietly hijacking your future.

Where your attention goes, your energy flows.

And that determines everything that follows.

But here’s the good news: you can reclaim it.

Here are three ways to take back control of your attention, and with it, your results.

Step #1: Audit what’s owning you
You can’t take back what you don’t realize you’ve lost.

Start by noticing what currently owns your attention.

When you open your laptop, where does your brain go first?

Email?
Slack?
Social media?
When you have five free minutes, what do you reach for?

The news?
Your phone?
A random task that doesn’t actually matter?

Most of us don’t decide where our attention goes.

We let it be decided for us.

But awareness is step one.

Spend one day simply observing your attention.

Ask yourself:

What’s hijacking my focus most often?
Is this thought or action moving me closer to what matters or further away?
The point isn’t to judge, it’s to notice.

Because once you see what’s owning your attention, you can start choosing differently.

Step #2: Replace reaction with intention
Your brain loves dopamine.

The little hits you get from checking messages, refreshing feeds, or “just peeking” at your inbox.
But every reaction is an opportunity you lose to create, think, or rest.

So, build boundaries that protect your attention before it’s stolen.

Start your day with direction, not distraction. No email, news, or social media for the first 30 minutes. Instead, review your top three priorities for the day.
Use Focus Windows. Pick a 25- or 50-minute block where you silence everything and work on one thing.
Don’t trust your willpower. Use tools like Focus, OneTab, or turning your phone face down.
Every time you pause before reacting, you’re training your brain to respond with intention instead of impulse.

Step #3: Reconnect to what deserves your energy
Once you’ve cleared the noise, it’s time to refill your focus with purpose.

Ask yourself:

If my attention is my most valuable resource, what truly deserves it?

It might be:

Strategizing a financial plan
Nurturing your health
Deepening your relationships
Finally finishing that project you keep postponing
Pick one area and make a Focus Pact with yourself.

“I promise to put in at least XX minutes a day to XX.”
Next, schedule it on your calendar.
Then, covet that time like your overdue hair appointment.

When you direct your attention toward what’s meaningful, your decisions, your habits, and your results start to align.

Because what owns your attention creates your reality.

The Bottom Line
You don’t need more hours in the day.

You need to be intentional with the hours you already have.

Your future isn’t shaped by luck, talent, or even hard work.

It’s shaped by focus.

If you want better results, start by paying attention to what you’re paying attention to.

Own your focus, and you own your future.

# This kicked my butt (and why it matters for your growth) 7.9.25

A few weeks ago, I took a new Dance Blast class.

As a Zumba lover for over a decade, this was right up my alley.

In fact, on my way out, someone even complimented me on how great I was.

Bahhahahahahaha. Got you.

I was terrible.

Couldn’t keep up with the choreography.

Up when everyone else was down.

Clipped my poor neighbor with a spastic arm swing (sorry, Row 4 Left Corner).

Friends gif. Courteney Cox as Monica dances awkwardly with stiff hips and arms. She has a concentrated look on her face as if she’s really focused on these bad dance moves.
It was humbling. And awkward. And uncomfortable.

And I’ve been back twice since.

Because I know this is how we grow.

Ever feel like you’re in a productivity rut?
You’re doing your job.
You’re checking the boxes.
You’re even hitting some goals.

But despite the hustle, you don’t really feel like you’re growing.

That feeling?

It usually means you’ve been hanging out in your comfort zone for too long.

Growth doesn’t happen when you keep doing the same moves on autopilot.

It happens when you intentionally shake things up.

No face-smacking in cardio class required.

Just these 3 simple steps:

Step 1: Start Something You’re Bad At
Yes, really.

Pick something outside your usual rhythm, professionally or personally.

Take on a new project that feels intimidating. (Pitch a new idea to an executive group).
Test a different way of running your meetings. (Assign time limits for each discussion point and actually use your timer.)
Try a productivity app you’ve resisted. (Give Notion a shot even though you think your head might explode.)
The goal isn’t to master it right away.

It’s to wake up your brain, stretch your skills, and get comfortable being uncomfortable.

Growth requires fresh energy.

Trying something new is how you spark it.

Step 2: Make It Public (Even a Little)
Tell someone – your team, your assistant, a friend:

“This is what I’m working on.”
When you say it out loud, you create gentle pressure.

You start showing up differently.

Even just sharing, “I’m working on managing my time better,” changes how others interact with you.

They respect your effort.

They notice your progress.

And you feel more accountable.

It’s not about perfection.

It’s about creating momentum.

Step 3: Stick With It (Especially When You Suck)
The real growth happens after the initial awkward phase.

Most people quit when things get messy or a little hard.

But that’s exactly when you should lean in.

Every time you flub the steps, forget your plan, or fall back into old habits…you’re still building awareness.

And awareness is the secret weapon.

Don’t ditch the process because it’s uncomfortable.

Stick with it because that’s how you improve.

The Bottom Line
You don’t have to take a dance class.

But you do have to move.

Growth doesn’t come from knowing more.

It comes from doing more with intention.

So, whether you’re

Testing new systems
Changing your calendar habits
Or finally, delegating bit by bit
Give yourself permission to mess up on the way to mastery.

Because the only way to get better is to get going.

And if you accidentally smack someone along the way, just smile and keep dancing.

You’ve got this. 💃🏽

# The most powerful move you’re probably not making 7.3.25

You know what it feels like.

You’re running a meeting, answering questions, navigating back-to-back emails, solving a teammate’s problem…

…and already behind on something important.

Yet, if you paused (and that’s a big IF…)

You would know exactly what to focus on next. (You’re smart like that.)

But that knowing only comes when you take responsibility.

Yes, take personal responsibility.

It’s the difference between spinning in overwhelm and making intentional decisions.

It’s how you stop wasting time figuring out why you’re stuck.

You start focusing on how to move forward.

When the outcome is someone else’s fault…When the chaos is outside your control…

It’s easy to feel helpless.

And in that space, you’ll find yourself asking unhelpful questions:

Why do I keep getting interrupted?
Why doesn’t anyone follow through?
How am I supposed to get it all done?
Those are not productive questions.

Try these three simple steps to shift from frustration to action.

Step 1: Own the Outcome
Instead of pointing to your team, your calendar, or your inbox…

Start with YOU.

Ask:
“What did I do (or not do) that contributed to this result?”

Did I train my team to depend on me for answers instead of empowering them to solve problems?
Did I let my calendar become overloaded without setting boundaries?
Did I establish clear expectations, or just assume people would “get it”?
Take ownership of your outcome, and you open the door to change.

If you created it, you can fix it.

Step 2: Identify What You Can Control
You don’t control how others behave.

But you do control your responses, your choices, and your systems.

Start with what’s within your power:

Block time for focused work
Set boundaries for meetings
Say no more often (even when it feels uncomfortable – it’s time to retrain yourself)
Your power comes from:

Putting your energy where it matters
Focusing on what you can change
Step 3: Choose a Simple Solution
Now make it actionable.

One step.

One change.

One commitment.

Not a massive overhaul – just a clear path forward.

Maybe you:

Tell your team, “I trust you to make the call. I don’t need to be in the loop on every detail.”
Take 10 minutes to plan your top three priorities before the chaos begins.
Pause before you say “yes” to one more thing.
Simplify your solution.

You will get focused.

And you will gain momentum.

The bottom line…

Leadership doesn’t mean solving every problem.

It means being willing to look at yourself first.

That’s where clarity lives.

That’s where your power is.

And that’s how you go from overwhelmed to unstoppable.

When you are the source of the problem, you are always the source of the solution.

Own it – and you’ll always know what to do.

To your success,

# 3 Ways to stay fueled, not fried 6.25.25

With your packed calendar, never-ending list of to-dos, and a lot of people counting on you, slowing down can feel…impossible.

There’s always something else to get done.

Another person to support.
Another email to answer.

But here’s the deal:

Burnout doesn’t happen because you’re working hard.

It happens because you’re not recovering.

Even the most high-performing leaders, execs, and pros can’t sprint all day.

You can’t pour out nonstop without putting something back in.

You don’t need to stop achieving.

You need to start refueling.

And if you lead a team?

Your energy sets the tone.

If you’re running on empty, they will too.

Burnout is contagious. But so is balance.

Here are three ways to stay fueled (not fried), so you protect your performance.

#1: Schedule non-negotiable pauses
It’s tempting to think: “I don’t have time to take a break.”

But a 3–5 minute reset is better than a 3-day crash.

These micro-breaks don’t just help you feel better.

They make you more focused, more present, and a better decision-maker.

In the grand scheme of your day, we’re talking 3-5 minutes.

It’s completely doable.

And when your team sees you taking breaks without guilt? They’re more likely to do the same.

That means fewer mistakes, fewer emotional reactions, and a whole lot less rework.

Try this:

Stretch at your desk.
Step outside for fresh air.
Close your eyes and breathe.
These tiny resets create better results for you and your team.

#2: Switch between mental and physical tasks
If you’ve just spent two hours reviewing reports or prepping for a presentation, don’t jump into another brain-heavy task.

Your focus will dip. Your productivity will tank.

And you’ll probably end up doom-scrolling or staring at your inbox instead.

Give your brain a break by shifting into something physical:

Take a walk.
Tidy your space.
Refill your water and move around.
When your team watches you balance intensity with recovery, it gives them permission to manage their own energy more effectively.

It’s a total win-win.

#3: Set boundaries on work creep
You know the drill:

You finally get a second to breathe…and you’re checking emails at 10 PM.

Celebrity gif. Conan O'brien stands in front of CrossFit weights. He drops to his knees and covers his face with his hands while screaming in agony. Text, "WHYYYYY".
It feels productive in the moment.

But it’s a fast track to mental fatigue.

Just because you can work around the clock doesn’t mean you should.

Instead, put limits around your work time and protect your high-priority tasks by actually putting them on your calendar.

Boundaries aren’t about being rigid.

They’re about being strategic.

And when you lead with boundaries, you build a culture that values focused work over frantic work.

The bottom line:

Burnout isn’t about doing too much.

It’s about not balancing the right things.

And when you model balance, you help your team do the same, creating a healthier, more effective organization.

So here’s your challenge:

What’s one small boundary or habit you can put in place starting today?

One pause.
One switch.
One “no” to late-night email.
That’s where recovery begins.

Let me know what you’re trying—I’d love to hear.

# Fed up with nonstop crises? 6.18.25

You know when you’re finally in the zone.

Focused. Making progress.

Until…

Your phone rings.

Your inbox pings.

Someone swings by with: “Quick question—it’s urgent.”

And just like that, their emergency becomes your distraction.

Sound familiar?

The reality is that not every fire is yours to put out.

But when you’re the go-to person, the responsible one, the reliable teammate or leader, it’s easy to get pulled in.

Even when it’s not your job.
Even when it’s not aligned with your priorities.
Even when it derails your day.
So, how do you stay helpful without becoming a dumping ground for other people’s chaos?

Here are three ways to protect your focus and still support your team.

1: Slow the rescue reflex
When someone implies, “I need this now,” our instinct is to drop everything and help.

But here’s the thing:

Their urgency doesn’t automatically equal your emergency.

Before reacting, pause and ask:

What’s really going on here?
Does this fall under my role or responsibility?
Is this urgent, or just poorly planned?
Try responding with curiosity instead of jumping straight into fix-it mode.

Like this:

“I want to help. Can you give me a little context so I can see where this fits in with everything I have going on?”

That one pause can save your entire afternoon.

2: Protect your priorities with language
You can be respectful and direct.

You can be collaborative and have boundaries.

Try these phrases to buy time or redirect responsibility:

“I’m focused on [X] right now. Can we talk at [Y time] instead?”

“That sounds important. Have you already brought it to [person/team]?”

“Happy to take a look, but I’d need to shift a few other things. Is that the best use of time right now?”

You’re not saying “no” to the person.

You’re saying “yes” to your priorities.

3: Look for patterns and solve them upstream
If you find yourself constantly pulled into last-minute drama, there’s likely a systems issue.

Maybe it’s unclear who owns what.

Maybe your role needs clearer boundaries.

Maybe your team needs better planning practices.

Patterns are signals.

And signals are solvable.

Start tracking:

What types of emergencies keep coming up?
Who’s usually involved?
When do they tend to happen?
Then initiate a bigger conversation.

Solving the root issue is far more productive than firefighting the symptoms.

The bottom line:

You can be helpful without being hijacked.

Supportive without being reactive.

Kind without being constantly available.

Every time you protect your focus, you give others permission to do the same.

So, what’s one phrase or habit you can use this week to pause before jumping into someone else’s fire?

Shoot me a reply and let me know what you’re trying.

Let’s do this,

# The one shift that helped me 10x my time 6.11.25

I used to end my workday feeling wiped out but wondering, What did I even get done today?

Emails answered? Yes.

Meetings attended? Check.

But progress on the stuff that actually mattered? Not so much.

Feel familiar?

That all changed when I made one shift.

I stopped writing things down on my to-do list and started planning for them instead.

Here’s how that small change turned into a massive boost in productivity (and sanity).

#1: I schedule tasks like I schedule meetings
You wouldn’t blow off a client call just because an email popped up.

So why do we treat our priorities like they’re optional?

The game-changer for me was putting my most important tasks on my calendar, just like meetings.

Not scribbled on a to-do list.

Not floating around in my head. But actually time-blocked.

Now, when I sit down at 10 am, I’m not thinking, What should I work on next?

I know exactly what to do and when to do it.

The clarity is unreal.

#2: I protect time for deep work
Distractions don’t just cost you minutes – they cost momentum.

That’s why I block off 45-minute chunks in the morning for focused work.

No email. No phone. No interruptions.

This is when I make real progress on the needle-moving stuff: strategizing, writing, planning.

Not just reacting all day.

Even just one distraction-free block a day adds up to serious gains over a week.

And yes, your brain will thank you.

#3: I batch similar tasks to stop the mental ping-pong
Task-switching is productivity’s worst enemy.

Answering a Slack message, then jumping to a spreadsheet, then firing off an email…

It’s a recipe for burnout and inefficiency.

Now I group similar tasks together.

Emails? Batch ‘em.
Client calls? Back-to-back.
Planning? All in one block.
When your brain isn’t constantly shifting gears, you work faster and smarter.

The ripple effect on teams and organizations

When individuals start planning with intention, it changes everything.

But when an entire team or organization does it?

Productivity doesn’t just improve. It multiplies.

You get fewer dropped balls.

Fewer fire drills.

And more time spent on what actually drives results.

The Bottom Line

You don’t need to overhaul your life to take back your time.

You just need to plan for what matters before the day takes over.

It starts with one shift: putting your priorities on the calendar.

That’s how you go from busy to effective.

From reactive to intentional.

So, reply and let me know: What’s one thing you’re going to plan first today?

Start there. Then build momentum.

# 3 Steps to actually finish big tasks 6.6.25

You know that big project you’ve been avoiding?

The proposal. The report. The presentation.

It’s not that you don’t care.

It’s just that it feels massive.

And when something feels too big, your brain does what it does best:

It delays, distracts, and avoids.

But here’s the truth: You’re not lazy or disorganized.

The task is simply too vague.

Your brain doesn’t know where to begin, so it doesn’t.

Here’s the fix: Break big tasks into timed chunks.

Here’s how to do it in 3 simple steps.

Step 1: Break It Down
Start by identifying the smaller parts that make up the big goal.

Instead of “create training deck,” break it into:

Brainstorm outline
Write talking points
Design 5 slides
Add visuals
Review and edit
This turns something abstract into something actionable.

Suddenly, it’s not a giant, scary project.

It’s a series of manageable tasks you can actually do.

Step 2: Assign Time Blocks
Once you’ve broken down your task, assign a time limit to each part.

Not just “work on slides,” but:

Brainstorm outline (20 minutes)
Write the first half of the content (45 minutes)
Add images to slides 1–5 (30 minutes)
Assigning a time to each chunk forces clarity and provides a container to focus on.

You’ll stop overworking simple tasks and stop underestimating what’s involved.

Bonus: Add each block to your calendar.

If it’s not scheduled, it’s just a wish.

And how well has that worked out for you?

Step 3: Focus on One Chunk at a Time
When it’s time to work, resist the urge to tackle the whole project.

Just focus on the next block.

Stay with it.

You can do it if you set the intention first.

Set a timer for 30 to 60 minutes.

No switching tabs.

No checking messages.

Once the timer’s up, decide:

Am I done?
Do I need another chunk?
Chunk by chunk, you’ll build momentum and move forward with way less stress.

Why This Works
Your brain LOVES direction.

Big, vague projects create resistance.

But smaller, timed chunks?

They give you a starting point, a finish line, and a sense of progress.

And the ripple effect?

When you work this way, your team starts to work this way too.

You create a culture that values focus, direction, and consistency, not last-minute chaos.

Try This Today
Pick one task that’s been sitting on your list for too long.

Break it down.
Assign time blocks.
Tackle the first chunk today.
No more procrastinating.

No more staring at the mountain.

Just step by step.

All the way to done.

You got this,

# How to use technology like a boss 5.30.25

Isn’t it crazy that you can book a flight, schedule a dentist appointment, and find the best Thai takeout before you finish your coffee?

Technology is insanely fast, convenient, and supposed to make life easier.

But instead of saving us time, it’s quietly hijacking our attention.

We open our phones to check the weather…

And 20 minutes later, we’ve scrolled through vacation photos (from someone we haven’t talked to in five years…)

Then bought a pair of slippers…

And totally forgot what we were doing in the first place.

Can you relate?

Technology should work for you, not control you.

The key is creating boundaries that keep you in charge.

Here are three easy ways to make that happen:

#1: Turn off non-essential notifications.

If your phone lights up every time someone likes a post, adds a new video, or restocks an item, you’ll constantly feel behind.

You do not need a pop-up every two seconds.

I feel this needs repeating:

You do not need a pop-up every two seconds.

Turn off notifications for anything that isn’t urgent or critical.

Your group texts can wait.

Your social apps can wait.

And yes, that retail sale can absolutely wait.

Your world will not fall apart.

In fact, your world will run way more smoothly.

When you reduce interruptions, your brain can stay focused.

Try it for just ONE day and see how much your stress comes down.

#2: Use app blockers.

We all have go-to time-sucks: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and even email.

We don’t even mean to open them. It’s just muscle memory.

App blockers like Freedom, StayFocusd, or your iPhone’s Screen Time settings can set digital boundaries.

Want to limit Instagram to 30 minutes a day? Done.

Need to block all social media from 9am to 12pm so you can focus? You can do that too.

Newsflash: It is in YOUR control.

It’s not about cutting everything out.

It’s about being intentional.

There’s no excuse not to use free, simple tools at your fingertips.

#3: Batch your digital tasks.

One of the fastest ways to drain your energy?

Checking emails, messages, and notifications All. Day. Long.

Instead, choose set times to check your inbox and respond to messages.

Maybe that’s 10am, 1pm, and 4:30pm.

The rest of the time?

Close the tabs. Put your phone face down.

Focus on the work (or the break) in front of you.

You’ll be amazed how much calmer and more productive you feel when your brain isn’t constantly switching gears.

Yes, it can feel hard.

But playing catch-up when you’re constantly behind and overwhelmed is much harder.

It’s your choice. Do you want hard or much harder?

The Bottom Line

You want to be a leader who models focus and discipline.

The kind who doesn’t just talk about boundaries, but lives them.

Because when you’re intentional with your time, it gives everyone permission to do the same.

That’s how you create a culture of clarity, not chaos.

Of ownership, not overwhelm.

It’s not just about using less tech.

It’s about using it with purpose.

Don’t overcomplicate this. All three strategies are SIMPLE.

So, which one are you going to try first?

# Want to shave 10 hours off every week? 5.14.25

Isn’t it annoying to walk out of a one-hour meeting when you know you could have gotten the same amount done in just 15 minutes?

Poorly run meetings are one of the biggest and most tolerated productivity killers.

The good news? There’s one simple fix.

A better agenda.

Not just any agenda. One that people actually stick to.

Every agenda needs three essential elements to make meetings more productive and purposeful.

#1: Keep It to 3–5 Bullet Points, Max.

More than five items on your agenda?

That’s not a meeting – that’s a marathon.

Without concise agendas, discussions drag, priorities get muddled, and meetings lose focus fast.

Keep your meeting tight with just 3 – 5 key discussion points.

If you have more than that, split the topics into separate meetings.

This one change keeps the conversation clear, the energy up, and the meeting on time.

#2: Assign Ownership to Each Agenda Item.

A huge reason meetings go off the rails?

No one knows who’s leading the conversation.

Assign a person to each bullet point on the agenda.

It could be someone presenting a challenge or facilitating a discussion.

When people have ownership, they show up prepared. They contribute.

This boosts engagement, creates accountability, and helps the group stay focused.

Plus, it eliminates awkward moments, thinking “who’s supposed to be running this part?”

#3: Add Time Parameters to Every Topic.

This is the agenda detail almost no one uses – but it’s the one that will change everything.

Assign a specific time frame to each discussion item.

When everyone knows their time, they tend to be more concise and focused.

It also allows the meeting facilitator to redirect people who are going off track or running too long.

So, to put the three elements together: concise points, assigned ownership, and time boundaries, here’s what an effective agenda might look like:

Problem setup – Ryan: 5 minutes
Brainstorming solutions – Group: 15 minutes
Recap of top 3 ideas – Nancy: 5 minutes
The Bottom Line

You want to be seen as a leader who values your team’s time.

You want people to leave your meetings feeling energized, not drained.

That doesn’t happen when your meetings drag, ramble, or go nowhere.

It happens when you lead with clarity, structure, and purpose.

When people know you don’t waste time, they trust you to lead bigger conversations, bigger projects, and bigger results.

That’s how you stop being just “good at your job.”

You become the one people count on.

Let’s make it happen.

# One simple shift to instantly boost your focus 5.9.25

Staying focused is really tough.

Between emails, texts, pings, and that irresistible urge to check just one more tab, multitasking feels like the only way to survive.

We constantly bounce, half-working, half-scrolling, and totally drained by 3 pm.

But what if the real game changer isn’t doing more at once… but doing just one thing at a time?

Yep. I’m talking about single-tasking, and it’s wildly underrated.

Here are three simple steps to making this awesome change.

#1. Know the Cost of Multitasking
Multitasking feels like productivity, but in reality?

It’s a total drain.

Every time you switch between writing a report and answering an email, your brain takes time to refocus.

That mental “lag” may be just a few seconds each time, but it adds up fast.

Task switching can reduce your productivity by 40%.

It’s not just your time that suffers; your energy also takes a hit.

You feel scattered, exhausted, and more prone to errors.

And that sense of “I worked all day but got nothing done”?

That’s multitasking’s signature move.

#2. Adoptt Single-Tasking Instead
Here’s the shift: instead of juggling everything, do one thing at a time.

Fully. From start to finish. Then move on to the next.

It sounds ridiculously simple, but it works.

You’ll move faster, think more clearly, and get better results.

And let’s not overlook the joy of actually finishing something.

That satisfying moment of crossing a task off your list?

It’s the best.

#3. Use Time Blocks to Stay Focused
Want to make single-tasking easier? Enter: Time Blocking.

Set aside a chunk of time, 15, 30, or even 60 minutes, and commit it to just one task.

Silence notifications, close unrelated tabs, and give that task your full attention.

When the time’s up, take a break or switch gears.

Time blocking creates a container for your focus.

It helps you resist the temptation to task-hop, and gives your brain the structure it craves.

Protect your time like it’s your most valuable asset (because it is).

Challenge the idea that multitasking is the key to getting it all done.

If you’re overwhelmed or constantly behind, try single-tasking.

Choose just one task, block time for it, and give it your full attention.

No pings. No switching. Just presence.

You’ll be amazed at how much better and lighter your day feels.

# You can beat procrastination Instantly 04.30.25

You know that nagging feeling when your to-do list is filled with little things that somehow feel huge?

A two-line email you still haven’t sent.
That one receipt sitting on your desk.
A voicemail you haven’t returned.
These micro-tasks might seem harmless, but when they pile up, they start weighing you down.

Those tiny things steal more energy than you realize.

But here’s a simple strategy to instantly shift your day: The 2-Minute Rule.

Let’s break down how this works.

#1: Identify your 2-minute (or less) tasks

Think:

Replying to a short email
Making a quick call
Putting a dish in the dishwasher
Jotting down a note
These tasks are so small that we often ignore them because they seem insignificant.

But unfortunately, putting them off only makes them worse.

They float in the back of your brain, clutter your mental space, and fester into low-grade stress.

No doubt you have plenty of these tiny tasks all day, so the first step is to start catching them.

#2: Just do it (now!)

Here’s the magic:

Don’t write it down. Don’t schedule it for later.

If it takes two minutes or less, do it right now.

That email? Hit send.

That empty coffee cup? Rinse and go.

When you act immediately, you not only remove the task – you remove the weight of it.

You will instantly feel lighter.

Start building the habit of “It’s so small, so I take care of it now.”

#3: Ride the momentum wave

Doing one small thing creates this tiny, satisfying sense of progress.

And guess what?

That sense of progress creates motivation.

Not the other way around.

We think we need motivation first to get things done – but in reality, action is what sparks motivation.

Knocking out one 2-minute task will motivate you to do another…and then another.

The more you get done, the more you’ll get done.

The 2-Minute Rule isn’t just about saving time.

It clears mental clutter, boosts confidence, and puts you back in the driver’s seat.

Plus, the more you practice it, the more you’ll spot these quick wins throughout your day.

So here’s your challenge: Pick one 2-minute task you’ve been avoiding – and just do it.

Don’t think. Don’t overanalyze.

Just start.

Then, notice how your energy shifts.

You might find yourself on a roll, and before you know it, that to-do list looks much less overwhelming.

Procrastination thrives on avoidance. But momentum? That thrives on action.

And sometimes, all it takes is two minutes.

# 3 Steps to instantly stop overcommitting 4.24.25

Ever find yourself saying yes to something and instantly regretting it?

You’re not alone.

Overcommitting is one of the fastest ways to burn out, lose focus, and drift away from what really matters.

If your calendar is packed and your energy is drained, it’s time to embrace one simple but powerful shift: Saying No.

When you say no to the wrong things, you make space for the right things—your priorities, your well-being, and your goals.

Here are three simple steps to protect your time and focus:

#1: Hit Pause

Before automatically saying yes, hit pause.

Ask yourself: Does this align with my top priorities or goals?

If the answer is no—or even a hesitant maybe—that’s your cue to reconsider.

Not every opportunity is the right opportunity.

Some are just distractions dressed as something important.

Give yourself permission to decline the things that don’t serve you.

A thoughtful pause before a yes can save you hours—or even days—down the line.

#2: Be CLEAR In Your Response

Only once you’ve paused can you develop a clear response.

Here’s what NOT to say:

“I might be able to. I’m not sure, but I’ll try my best, and hopefully, I can do it. Most likely I’m in but can’t totally commit.”

That’s a wishy-washy, non-commitment that leaves you feeling guilty and the other person confused.

But a kind, direct response goes a long way.

“Thanks so much for thinking of me, but I’m focused on a few other commitments right now and can’t take on more.”

Bam. That’s it.

No drama, no guilt. There is no need to word vomit.

You’re not rejecting the person—you’re simply honoring your own capacity.

#3: Be Clear About Your Boundaries

Actually take 5 minutes to WRITE DOWN your boundaries.

You think you know them, but they’re mushy in your head, and you really haven’t set them.

Get crystal clear on your rules of engagement so you can let other people know.

That might mean:

I’m not taking meetings before 11 am.
I have “no call” time during deep work blocks, 8:30 am – 10:30 am.
I spend time on emails for 45 minutes three times a day.
I schedule no more than four meetings a day.
I close my laptop at 6 pm.
Write them down so there is no confusion!!

Saying no isn’t rejection. It’s redirection.

It’s a conscious choice to align with what matters most.

So this week:

Practice the pause.
Be clear about the no.
Write down a boundary.
And notice how much more in control you feel.

# 5-minutes to the best day ever 4.10.25

We’ve all had those mornings where the day starts in a blur—emails, notifications, and your brain spinning before you’ve even had coffee.

Feeling defeated before the day starts.

But what if you could take just five minutes to completely shift the tone of your day?

Yes, just 5 minutes.

Sounds too simple? It is—and that’s exactly why it works.

This isn’t about overhauling your morning or waking up at 5 a.m. (That is so not me!)

It’s about small, intentional actions that build momentum and focus—before life takes over.

Here’s how to do it, Every. Morning:

First, #1: One Minute of Planning

Spend one minute writing down your top three priorities.

Not your full to-do list—just the three most important tasks that would make you feel awesome.

This simple act gives you a clear direction and a visual anchor for your day.

Instead of sinking into reactive mode, you focus on what matters most.

It’s a powerful way to squash overwhelm and stay aligned with your goals.

Three Priorities. One Minute.

Next, #2: One Minute of Mindfulness

You don’t need 20 minutes of meditation to feel its benefits.

Just 60 seconds of deep breathing or a guided meditation.

Set a one-minute timer; breathe in for four breaths and out for eight until the timer goes off.

This quick reset will instantly create calm and lower stress.

Doooooo it!

Last, #3: Three Minutes of Movement

You just need a little movement to wake up your body and brain.

That could be:

3 minutes of stretching or yoga poses.
A quick walk around your house (inside or out).
Some light weights while watching TV.
Movement boosts endorphins, clears mental fog, and sets the tone for better focus, creativity, and mood throughout the day.

And when you move early, you’re more likely to keep that energy flowing.

So, move it! Three minutes is totally doable.

You don’t need to overhaul your life to start seeing results.

But you do need to commit to just five minutes of intentional action.

It is the greatest bang for your time.

So stop overcomplicating or procrastinating.

Put a reminder on your phone for tomorrow morning right now:

Prioritize (1 min.)
Breathe (1 min.)
Move (3 min).
You will reclaim control.

You will boost your mindset.

You will start your day with purpose.

Don’t you owe it to yourself?

# What Morocco taught me about discipline (and it’s not what you think) 3.17.25

We just returned from a beautiful trip to Morocco—it was breathtaking.

But what moved me the most wasn’t the architecture, the food, or the colors (though those were amazing).

It was the discipline I witnessed during Ramadan.

From sunrise to sunset—no food, no water, no coffee.

Yet, people carried on their day with patience, warmth, and presence.

It was such a powerful reminder:

Discipline isn’t just about routines and checklists––but purposeful choices.

It’s choosing values over comfort.

Intentionality over impulse.

And doing it with grace.

That kind of discipline?

It’s not rigid. It’s empowering.

Where in your life could you bring that kind of purposeful discipline?

You don’t need to overhaul everything.

Just one intentional choice today could shift your entire week.

You’ve got this.

# Why motivation is overrated (and what actually works) 2.14.25

Motivation is one of the most common topics I work on with my clients.

It’s not that they’re not motivated.

They simply procrastinate on things they don’t want to do, which frustrates them like crazy.

The thing is, we all procrastinate on things we don’t want to do.

So, if you’re waiting for motivation — Stop.

The most productive people don’t rely on it—because motivation is unreliable.

You never really know when it will show up or spend days hiding in the shadows.

Instead of waiting to feel like doing something, use systems to get it done.

Here’s how:

#1: Make it easy to start.

Break big tasks into tiny steps—just five minutes of action builds momentum.

Instead of procrastinating getting to the gym for an hour, walk around the block for 20 minutes.

Drop the all-or-nothing attitude. It only holds you back.

#2: Create accountability.

Get a partner you can rely on.

You’re at least accountable to yourself, but you won’t disappoint a friend.

When others expect results, you’re more likely to follow through.

#3: Create a new routine.

When it’s part of your day, you don’t need to “feel like it.” You just do it.

Like when stretching while your coffee is brewing becomes part of your routine, it becomes something you always do.

Or, when writing down your priorities as soon as you sit down at your desk becomes a habit, you’ll do it every morning.

Motivation is overrated because people think it’s what’s holding them back or propelling them forward.

When, in fact, it’s one tiny action that deserves most of the credit.

Motivation comes after action, not the other way around.

Try this today: Take action before you feel ready.

You will get moving on the thing you’ve been putting off.

You will feel more accomplished.

You will build momentum for tomorrow.

And you’ll stop blaming your results on not being motivated.

# You can’t change people 1.30.25

One of the most common questions I get is,

“How do I get XX {insert any of the below} to change their organization/time management skills?

How do I get my colleague to change?
My best friend to change?
My boss to change?
My mom to change?
My roommate to change?
Maybe you can relate to these situations.

> You create specifically named folders, but your co-worker just won’t correctly put her papers away.
> 

> You have an area for your husband’s keys, wallet, and other stuff, but the items never go where they should.
> 

> You give plenty of heads up about meeting, but your friend texts that they’ll be 15 minutes late as you drive into the parking lot.
> 

If you want to know how to change the habits of your husband or your boss or your friend, or your mama – I have four words for you.

Good luck with that.

It’s not your job, and quite frankly, it’s not up to you to change anybody but yourself.

You don’t change people.

But there are a few things you CAN do to…influence them.

An influencer inspires or guides the actions or behaviors of others.

It’s not someone who forces change on somebody else.

When you find yourself in this frustrating position where people are not doing what you want, the first step is changing your mindset.

The Changer role usually does not end well.

The Influencer role is much more satisfying and rewarding.

Because you focus on YOU. You do you, Boo.

Here are three simple tips to become a pro influencer.

Master your system.
Lead by example.
Communicate your successes.
Instead of focusing on others, focus your energy and time on YOU doing your best job.

As Gandhi said, Be the change you wish to see in the world.

Example: If you wish people would value meetings more, show them how.

Master your system: Be intentional about invites, send resources ahead of time, and create your agenda.
Lead by example: Follow your agenda, get back on track when people start rambling, and start and end on time.
Communicate your successes: Let your team know the great results you get by running your meetings this way.
This takes practice.

People won’t change after one great meeting or one positive experience.

But by consistently showing up as your best, some of your awesome strategies will eventually rub off on others.

Move from the Changer to the Influencer.

It’s not your job to change people.

It’s your job to be the best you can be.

Are you ready for the challenge in 2025?

You always know what to do. Even when you have a hundred thoughts dominating your mind.

It comes down to taking responsibility.

**Taking responsibility is the difference between knowing why you aren’t using your time well and what to do to use your time well…or not.**

When your result is something you can’t control…

When your result is someone or something else’s fault…

It’s easy to not know what to do.

It’s easy to feel confused. To get paralyzed.
